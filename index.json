According to standard life-cycle savings theory, differences in time discounting behavior across individuals can play an important role for their position in the wealth distribution. Empirical testing of this hypothesis has been difficult because of serious data limitations. We overcome these limitations by linking an experimental measure of time discounting for a large sample of middle-aged individuals to Danish high-quality administrative data with information about their real-life wealth over the life-cycle as well as a large number of background characteristics. The results show that individuals with relatively low time discounting are persistently positioned higher in the wealth distribution. The relationship is of the same magnitude as the association between years of education and the position in the wealth distribution, and it robustly persists after controlling for a large number of theoretically motivated confounders such as education, risk aversion, school grades, income, credit constraints, initial wealth, and parental wealth. These findings support the view that individual differences in time discounting affect individuals’ positions in the wealth distribution through the savings channel.","tags":null,"title":"Time Discounting and Wealth Inequality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Piotr Sapiezynski","Arkadiusz Stopczynski","David Dreyer Lassen","Sune Lehmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576022400,"objectID":"3986a31fd561955d146af5eeeadb0a98","permalink":"https://daviddlassen.github.io/publication/cns_scidata/cnsdata/","publishdate":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cns_scidata/cnsdata/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe the multi-layer temporal network which connects a population of more than 700 university students over a period of four weeks.

Many households have high income and high total wealth, but low holdings of accessible or liquid savings. Since it is costly to extract illiquid wealth, consumption for these households potentially drops substantially in case of a temporary shock to income, for instance from being laid off. We hypothesize and show empirically that this implies that a substantial group of voters show strong support for social insurance policies despite being wealthy in terms of home equity and income, because of their limited ability to self-insure through own savings in case of an income shock. Our empirical analysis is based on a novel dataset from Denmark combining administrative data with high-quality measures of individual financial assets and survey measures of political preferences. Using data for other countries from the European Social Survey, we find evidence that our results hold more generally and are not specific to the Danish context.","tags":null,"title":"Middle Class without a Net: Savings, Financial Fragility and Preferences over Social Insurance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen","Asger Andersen","Kelton Minor","David Dreyer Lassen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568073600,"objectID":"ead28b8c393c2b9c29d58ccec5dda98a","permalink":"https://daviddlassen.github.io/publication_wp/smartphoneatt/smartphone_att/","publishdate":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication_wp/smartphoneatt/smartphone_att/","section":"publication_wp","summary":"We describe the multi-layer temporal network which connects a population of more than 700 university students over a period of four weeks.

We utilize a novel dataset where screentime was recorded continuously across multiple courses, allowing us to examine the link between students' smartphone use and grade at the individual level and the individual-in-course level. In an initial cross-sectional analysis, we find that students’ average in-class smartphone use is negatively related to their GPA, controlling for high school performance and salient individual characteristics. However, this relationship does not persist in a panel model with individual-in-course level observations where we include fixed effects for both students and classes. We conclude that cross-sectional models likely overestimate the effect of smartphone usage on grades due to unobserved individual and course traits. This suggests that researchers should not interpret even very well-controlled correlations between smartphone usage and academic performance as causal relations.","tags":null,"title":"By Our Own Devices: Smartphone Use and Academic Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Kommentar i Berlingske 3. juli 2019 (med Mads Eriksen, Dansk Erhverv)\nLæs den her\n","date":1562165832,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562165832,"objectID":"60536c0949d8aa7826a9cef4806cd72a","permalink":"https://daviddlassen.github.io/post/kronik_forskning_ensidigt/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T16:57:12+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/kronik_forskning_ensidigt/","section":"post","summary":"Kommentar i Berlingske 3. juli 2019 (med Mads Eriksen, Dansk Erhverv)\nLæs den her","tags":[],"title":"Dansk forskning risikerer at skride, hvis vi fokuserer for ensidigt","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Debatindlæg i Børsen 14. juni 2019 (med Birgitte Nauntofte, Novo Nordisk Fonden)\nLæs den her ($$)\n","date":1560524232,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560524232,"objectID":"3563510f825e6327c949ab57b538a0b1","permalink":"https://daviddlassen.github.io/post/kronik_borsen_dff_nnf/","publishdate":"2019-06-14T16:57:12+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/kronik_borsen_dff_nnf/","section":"post","summary":"Debatindlæg i Børsen 14. juni 2019 (med Birgitte Nauntofte, Novo Nordisk Fonden)\nLæs den her ($$)","tags":[],"title":"Hvem træder til, når regeringen ikke styrker dansk forskning?","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557854631,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557854631,"objectID":"be28d98f3b409b36230c33eb11d88f5b","permalink":"https://daviddlassen.github.io/publication_wp/dk_socialnetworks/","publishdate":"2019-05-14T19:23:51+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication_wp/dk_socialnetworks/","section":"publication_wp","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Dk_socialnetworks","type":"publication_wp"},{"authors":["James E.

We investigate such information diffusion by examining whether weak ties relay information about unemployment shocks in Denmark. We link surveys with rich population-level administrative data to overcome several difficulties of identifying causal effects. Mapping each respondent’s familial, vocational, and educational ties, we find that unemployment shocks afflicting second-degree weak ties —- individuals that voters interact with indirectly -— increase a voter’s self-assessed risk of becoming unemployed, perception of the national unemployment rate, support for unemployment insurance, and voting for left-wing political parties. Voters update about national aggregates from all shocks equally, whereas subjective perceptions and preferences respond primarily to unemployment shocks afflicting second-degree weak ties in similar industries. This implies that political preferences driven by information transmitted through weak ties principally reflect individual insurance -- rather than sociotropic -- motives.","tags":null,"title":"Contagious political concerns: How unemployment information passed between weak ties influences Danish voters","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summer 2019\nMain lecturer: Kristoffer Albris.\nCo-lecturers: David Dreyer Lassen and Morten Axel Pedersen.\nLink to UCPH page on course details\nThe age of social big data brings with it a range of ethical, legal and political issues. From the ethics of protecting individual online privacy, to the legal frameworks regulating internet giants such as Facebook and Google, new data governance issues surface at a rapid pace. This course provides students with an introduction to key legislative, political and ethical principles and debates from the perspectives of anthropology, law, sociology, political science, and related disciplines, concerning the governance of data, needed for a range of analysis and management positions across private, public and non-profit organizations.\nData governance concerns the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity and security of data used in private, public and non-profit organizations. Comprehensive data governance addresses issues of data stewardship, ownership, compliance, privacy, data risks, data sensitivity and data sharing, including how such issues exist between different entities within the same organization. It involves thinking through issues such as: What do new forms of data-driven surveillance mean for relations between citizens, businesses and nation states, and how are new legal issues such as the legal basis for decision support systems and algorithmic decisions in public and private organizations addressed within current European legislation? Students will be taught how to develop and implement ethically and politically informed procedures and infrastructures for organizing, managing and maintaining data and data products in public and private organizations. The course also introduces the most recent ethical and social-scientific models of data governance, including organizational models and risk assessments, and asks students to apply them to a real-world case of problem solving.\nCasework takes students through the main phases of data governance analysis and practice: identification of a data-related problem and its internal and external stakeholders; analysis of how legal, technical-infrastructural and social-organizational components of the problem interrelate; pre-screening of possible solutions, including their respective risks; and final proposal and pilot check of a new data governance scheme expected to be robust in the face of foreseeable near- and mid-term challenges. By drawing on cutting-edge research in anthropology, law, sociology, and related disciplines, the students will also be able to contextualize and situate the case-based work within existing scientific debates concerning data governance and ethics. The course is organized into three parts. First, we begin with an introduction to what can be done with social big data under current Danish and EU laws. This is followed by a consideration and discussion of what should (and should not) be done in more political and ethical terms. And finally, the course will discuss what could be done in terms of governance in different sectors of public administration (health, education, etc.), in the private business sector and in the non-profit sector.\n","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"91053359953e4f546f0d08d5325a2432","permalink":"https://daviddlassen.github.io/project/data_governance/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/data_governance/","section":"project","summary":"Ethics, Politics and Law","tags":null,"title":"Data governance","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In 2020, we open the doors to our two-year M.Sc. in Social Data Science.\nYou can read about here, though parts of it may test your Danish skills.

Increasingly, social data - data that capture how people behave and interact with each other - is available online in new, challenging forms and formats. This opens up the possibility of gathering large amounts of interesting data, to investigate existing theories and new phenomena, provided that the analyst has sufficient computer literacy, while at the same time being aware of the promises and pitfalls of working with various types of data.\nThis aim of this course is fivefold:\nWe will introduce students to the state of the art social science literature using computational methods and social data.\nWe will present students with an overview of key benefits and challenges of working with different kinds of social data.\nWe will show how various kinds of data (survey, web-based, experimental, administrative, etc.) can be used to answer different questions within the social sciences. Furthermore, we will discuss ethical challenges related to the use of different types of data.\nWe will introduce students to statistical techniques for predicting and classification, known as machine learning, and we will discuss how these methods relate to existing empirical tools within economics such as causal inference and regression.\nWe will present modern data science methods needed for working with computational social science and social data in practice. Being an effective economist and data scientist means spending large fractions of our time writing and debugging code. In this section you will learn how to write code that will clean, transform, scrape, merge, visualize and analyze social data.\n","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"c775a01a873301ae3eb93d57cce4fb6c","permalink":"https://daviddlassen.github.io/project/social_data_science/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/social_data_science/","section":"project","summary":"Introduction to Data Science Tools in Social Science","tags":null,"title":"Social Data Science","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Kronik i Berlingske 10. april 2019 (med Mogens Høgh Jensen og Lars Arge, det Kgl.

According to standard life-cycle savings theory, differences in time discounting behavior across individuals can play an important role for their position in the wealth distribution. Empirical testing of this hypothesis has been difficult because of serious data limitations. We overcome these limitations by linking an experimental measure of time discounting for a large sample of middle-aged individuals to Danish high-quality administrative data with information about their real-life wealth over the life-cycle as well as a large number of background characteristics. The results show that individuals with relatively low time discounting are persistently positioned higher in the wealth distribution. The relationship is of the same magnitude as the association between years of education and the position in the wealth distribution, and it robustly persists after controlling for a large number of theoretically motivated confounders such as education, risk aversion, school grades, income, credit constraints, initial wealth, and parental wealth. These findings support the view that individual differences in time discounting affect individuals’ positions in the wealth distribution through the savings channel.","tags":null,"title":"Time Discounting, Savings Behavior, and Wealth Inequality","type":"publication_wp"},{"authors":["Valentin Kassarnig","Enys Mones","Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen","Piotr Sapiezynski","David Dreyer Lassen","Sune Lehmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522540800,"objectID":"ae3df3d25f317e15046060250af68b65","permalink":"https://daviddlassen.github.io/publication/student_networks/studentnetworks/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/student_networks/studentnetworks/","section":"publication","summary":"Identifying the factors which influence academic performance is an essential part of educational research. Previous studies have documented the importance of personality traits, class attendance, and social network structure. However, because most of these analyses were based on a single behavioral aspect and/or small sample sizes, we lack a quantification of the interplay of these factors. Here, we infer the academic performance among a cohort of almost 1,000 freshmen based on data collected through smartphones, which the students used as their primary phone for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a single population allows us to directly compare the predictive power of individual and social characteristics. We find that a student's performance is best inferred from their social ties. Network indicators out-perform models based on individual characteristics. We confirm earlier findings indicating that class attendance is the most important predictor among the individual characteristics.

We investigate this function of networks with respect to unemployment shocks in post-financial crisis Denmark, where we link panel surveys to rich administrative data covering the entire population. Mapping each respondent’s educational, familial, and vocational ties, we find that unemployment shocks afflicting second-degree connections in other municipalities — individuals that a voter interacts with indirectly — increase a voters’ self-assessed risk of becoming unemployed, perception of the national unemployment rate, support for unemployment insurance, and probability of voting for left-wing political parties. Voters’ own unemployment concerns and political preferences respond primarily to unemployment shocks afflicting second-degree connections in similar industries, whereas voters update about national aggregates from all shocks equally. This implies that political preferences driven by information transmitted through weak ties principally reflect self-interested — rather than sociotropic — motives.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Contagious political concerns: Identifying unemployment shock information transmission using the Danish population network","type":"publication_wp"},{"authors":["Sebastian Barfort","Nikolaj Harmon","David D.

Based on measured attendance data of nearly 1,000 undergraduate students, we demonstrate that early and consistent class attendance strongly correlates with academic performance.

We show that income overreporting is most pronounced among individuals who share the characteristics of high-income individuals, in ways that suggest the presence of social desirability bias. Further, this leads to biased estimates and distorted conclusions in a number of common applications in political science, but a simple logarithmic transformation eliminates the bias.

Register data are collected by automatic third party reporting and the potential errors associated with the two data sources are therefore plausibly orthogonal. Two examples are given to illustrate the potential of combining survey and register data. In the first example expenditure survey records with information about total expenditure are merged with income tax records holding information about income and wealth. Income and wealth data are used to impute total expenditure which is then compared to the survey measure. Results suggest that the two measures match each other well on average. In the second example we compare responses to a one‐shot recall question about total gross personal income  collected in another survey  with tax records. Tax records hold detailed information about different types of income and this makes it possible to test if errors in the survey responseare related to the reporting of particular types of income. Results show bias in the mean and that the survey error has substantial variance. Results also show that the errors are correlated with conventional covariates suggesting that the errors are not of the classical type. The latter example illustrates how Denmark can be used as a “laboratory” for future validation studies. Tax records with detailed information about different types of income are available for the entire Danish population and can be readily merged to survey data. This makes it possible to test the ability of respondents to accurately report different types of income using different interviewing techniques and questions. The examples presented in this paper are based on cross section data. However, the possibility to issue surveys repeatedly to the same persons and linking up to longitudinal tax records provides an opportunity to learn more about the time series properties of measurement errors, a subject about which little evidence exist, in the future.","tags":null,"title":"Measuring the Accuracy of Survey Responses using Administrative Register Data: Evidence from Denmark","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James E.

However, the evidence linking transparency and fiscal policy outcomes is less compelling. To analyze the effects of fiscal transparency on public debt accumulation, we present a career-concerns model with political parties. This allows us to integrate as implications of a single model three hitherto-separate results in the literature on deficit and debt accumulation: that transparency decreases debt accumulation (at least by reducing an electoral cycle in deficits), that right-wing governments (at least for strategic reasons) tend to have higher deficits than left-wing governments, and that increasing political polarization increases debt accumulation. To test the predictions of the model, we construct a replicable index of fiscal transparency on 19-country OECD data. Simultaneous estimates of debt and transparency strongly confirm that a higher degree of fiscal transparency is associated with lower public debt and deficits, independent of controls for explanatory variables from other approaches.","tags":null,"title":"Fiscal transparency, political parties, and debt in OECD countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James E.

While some recent political economy literature on electoral cycles identifies such cycles mainly in weak and recent democracies, in contrast we show, conditioning on a new index of institutional fiscal transparency, that electoral cycles in fiscal balance are a feature of many advanced industrialized economies. Using a sample of 19 OECD countries in the 1990s, we identify a persistent pattern of electoral cycles in low (er) transparency countries, while no such cycles can be observed in high (er) transparency countries. Furthermore, we find, in accordance with recent theory, that electoral cycles are larger in politically more polarized countries.","tags":null,"title":"Transparency, political polarization, and political budget cycles in OECD countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David D.

Recent formal theories of voter turnout emphasize a positive effect of being informed on the propensity to vote, but the possibility of endogenous information acquisition makes estimation of causal effects difficult. I estimate the causal effects of being informed on voter turnout using unique data from a natural experiment Copenhagen referendum on decentralization. Four of fifteen districts carried out a pilot project, exogenously making pilot city district voters more informed about the effects of decentralization. Empirical estimates based on survey data confirm a sizeable and statistically significant causal effect of being informed on the propensity to vote.","tags":null,"title":"The effect of information on voter turnout: Evidence from a natural experiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James E.

Empirically, it shows that political institutions have a role in explaining the prevalence of political corruption in American states. In the states, a set of democracies where the rule of law is relatively well established and the confounding effects of differing electoral systems and regimes are absent, institutional variables relating to the openness of the political system inhibit corruption. That is, other things equal, the extent to which aspiring politicians can enter and gain financial backing, and to which voters can focus their votes on policies and thereby hold incumbent politicians accountable for policy outcomes and find substitutes for them if dissatisfied with those outcomes, reduce corruption as a general problem of agency. These institutional effects are estimated in the presence of controls for variables representing other approaches.","tags":null,"title":"The political economy of institutions and corruption in American states","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James E.

We construct an index of fiscal transparency for the American states from detailed budgetary information. With cross-sectional data for 1986–95, we find that—on average and controlling for other factors—fiscal transparency increases both the scale of government and gubernatorial approval. Our results imply that more transparent fiscal institutions induce greater effort by politicians, to whom voters give higher job approval, on average. Voters also respond by entrusting greater resources to politicians where fiscal institutions are more transparent, leading to larger government.","tags":null,"title":"Fiscal transparency, gubernatorial approval, and the scale of government: Evidence from the states","type":"publication"}]
